I have tombs for important and wealthy individuals in mind with this set of tables. Each tomb will likely have an entry chamber that the PCs will find after passing through the tomb's entrance. The tomb will also have a grand crypt where the deceased individual honored by the tomb is buried—or, where it appears that the person is buried. Other functional rooms and crypts will be arranged in some manner that makes sense in relation to the entry chamber and the grand crypt, or at least makes sense in terms of the history of the tomb's building (and possible expansions).",
